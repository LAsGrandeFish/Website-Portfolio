[Fundemental App Startup & Controls]
ctrl + c    :   end next.js app
npm run dev :   builds project


[Typical git work flow]
git status                  : checks for modified files
git add .                   : adds all modified files to stage for commit 
git commit -m '<message>'   : commits changes with message about what you changed (on local machine)
git push origin main        : push to remote respository


[Creating a new branch and pushing it to github]
git switch -c <new-branch>      : creates and switches to new branch (locally)
git push -u origin <new-branch> : pushes a branch to github that you have never pushed before and enable tracking

** <new-branch> has created a pull request on GitHub and was merged **
** clean up below **

git switch main                 : switches back to main
git fetch --prune               : update remote repos, Git cleans up branches that no longer exist on GitHub
git branch -d <new-branch>      : safe deletes branch (won't delete if unmerged changes exist; cleans up locally)
